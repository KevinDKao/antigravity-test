# Liker

Use the mouse tracker script to see your x and y position. 

Use iPhone mirroring on a MacOS device to control your phone from your mac. Set it to the top right of your screen.

Change the pixel coordinates in the liker script to match your phone's screen, maybe change the timing depending on the loading and such.
